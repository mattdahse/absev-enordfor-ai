They discovered the bandits had allies and support from a larger criminal organization, indicating a more extensive threat in the region.
They found maps showing other bandit hideouts, which could be potential targets for future missions.
Current Situation
The party now has a clear understanding of the bandit threat and their future plans. They have captured the remaining bandits and gathered crucial intelligence about the criminal network.

Next Steps

With the captured bandits in tow and valuable information at hand, the party sets off towards Brightwater, ready to assist in thwarting the bandit menace and ensuring the safety of the region.
