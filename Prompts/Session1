#### Meeting at the Golden Griffin
**Elara**, **Lira**, and **Mei Lin** met at the Golden Griffin inn. Elara and Lira were looking for companions to help explore ancient ruins and a monastery, while Mei Lin was on a quest for enlightenment, seeking an ancient monastery rumored to be in the area. They decided to join forces to explore the ruins and find the monastery.

#### Journey to the Ruins
The group, joined by **Alric**, a ranger who offered to guide them, set off towards the ruins. They acquired supplies, including a mule for carrying their gear. Along the way, they faced several challenges:

2. **Rest and Recovery**: The group set up camp, divided the loot, and took turns keeping watch.

#### Exploring the Ruins
