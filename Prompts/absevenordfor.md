### Setting of Absev Enordfor and the Local Area

#### Absev Enordfor Overview

Absev Enordfor is a vast and ancient world filled with diverse landscapes, rich history, and numerous civilizations. The name of the world has been lost to time, with legends suggesting that the original founders named it in their own language. The world consists of at least two known continents, known to Pharmian cartographers as the North and South Continents. The North Continent is the primary focus of this adventure.

#### North Continent

The North Continent is divided by a large mountain range into an eastern and western half. The western half is more civilized and divided into three major peninsulas, considered the heart of civilization by its inhabitants. The climate and geography vary significantly across the continent, creating distinct regions.

**Western Half:**

1. **Northernmost Peninsula:**
   - **Climate:** The northern side of the mountain range is cold steppe and tundra, while the southern side is temperate, similar to New England.
   - **Terrain:** Mountainous along its length, with harsh, cold environments to the north and more temperate climates to the south.

2. **Middle Peninsula:**
   - **Climate:** Similar to the Scottish highlands.
   - **Terrain:** Large swamp and boggy wetlands, kept flooded by tributaries from the mountains and a magical breach into the elemental plane of water.

3. **Southern Peninsula:**
   - **Climate:** Mild, similar to southern Europe.
   - **Terrain:** Rolling hills, plains, and fertile lands. Home to the oldest and most densely populated Pharmian civilization.

**Eastern Half:**

- **Climate:** Varied, with a heavily forested northern region and jagged mountains similar to the Alps or Himalayas. The southern part has hills, canyons, and more even terrain.
- **Terrain:** One major bay from the southern ocean, forests, mountains, and gradually flattening landscapes.

**Southern Coast:**

- **Islands:** Two large islands just south of the southernmost peninsula of the western half.

#### Local Area: Areus and Zereus

**Areus:**
- **Primary Deity:** Ares.
- **Location:** Situated on the southern coast of the southern peninsula, closer to the mainland.
- **Geography:** Very hilly, quickly turning to steep, wild mountains filled with monstrous humanoids and creatures.
- **Climate:** Similar to Greece, with warm equatorial currents keeping the lowlands mild and the highlands barren and rocky.
- **Current Events:** The succession of the current ruler, the grandson of Jason, was contested but reluctantly accepted. The city is on the brink of turmoil, with the populace spoiling for a fight, inspired by their warlike god.

**Zereus:**
- **Primary Deity:** Apollo.
- **Location:** Neighboring city-state to Areus, also situated on the southern coast of the southern peninsula.
- **Oracle:** The city hosts a Greek-style oracle run by the temple of Apollo, providing divine guidance and prophecy.
